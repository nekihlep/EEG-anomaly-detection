EEG Anomaly Detection is an machine learning pipeline designed to identify abnormal brain activity patterns in EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. The system learns from healthy patients, then detects deviations in spectral power across 6 frequency bands, enabling binary classification of patients as "healthy" or "anomalous". Post-detection statistical analysis reveals disorder-specific spectral signatures for 9+ mental health conditions.

Core Concept: "If it doesn't look like a healthy brain, flag it — then figure out how it's different."

✨ Key Features
Automated pipeline for loading and preprocessing a real clinical EEG dataset
Unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoder and Isolation Forest
Empirical EEG norm built from healthy participants (18–30 years)
Relative power analysis across six standard frequency bands
Visualization of diagnostic spectral patterns (heatmaps / plots)
📂 Data & Problem Setting
[Dataset: open Kaggle dataset “EEG Psychiatric Disorders Dataset”] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/eeg-psychiatric-disorders-dataset) EEG features:

Absolute power (AB) in six bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, high beta, gamma
114 numerical features per subject (AB × electrodes / regions)
Task:
Binary: healthy vs pathology (anomaly detection, training only on healthy)
Descriptive: comparison of relative power patterns across diagnoses
Coherence (COH) features are present in the dataset but not yet used in this version of the project.

🧮 Machine Learning Pipeline
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Scaling & Norm

Standardization parameters (mean, std) are computed on healthy participants 18–30
The same transformation is applied to all subjects (healthy + patients)
Healthy group defines an empirical EEG norm
Autoencoder (MLP)

Symmetric feedforward network trained to reconstruct standardized EEG features of healthy controls
Reconstruction error (MSE) used as an anomaly score
Threshold: 90‑th percentile of errors in healthy group → binary label
predicted_healthy / predicted_pathology
Isolation Forest

Tree‑based anomaly detector trained on the same healthy subset
Used as a baseline model for comparison under strong class imbalance
📊 Spectral Analysis & Visualisation
Empirical norm is computed for each spectral feature on healthy 18–30 group
For each subject and each band, relative deviation is computed as percent difference from norm
Diagnostic groups (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder, OCD, bipolar disorder, etc.) are compared by: Mean relative power deviations in delta–gamma bands
Heatmaps showing patterns of increases/decreases vs healthy norm
This allows exploring candidate EEG biomarkers and shared vs distinct spectral patterns across disorders.
