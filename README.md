EEG Anomaly Detection is an machine learning pipeline designed to identify abnormal brain activity patterns in EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. The system learns from healthy patients, then detects deviations in spectral power across 6 frequency bands, enabling binary classification of patients as "healthy" or "anomalous". Post-detection statistical analysis reveals disorder-specific spectral signatures for 9+ mental health conditions.

Core Concept: "If it doesn't look like a healthy brain, flag it — then figure out how it's different."
